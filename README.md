ðŸ”§ Mastering Version Control: A Deep Dive into SVN & Mercurial
ðŸ“š Introduction to Version Control Systems
Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for managing software changes, enabling collaboration, and maintaining project history.

âœ¨ Types of Version Control Systems
Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) â€“ A single central server stores all versions (e.g., Subversion (SVN)).
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) â€“ Each user has a full repository copy (e.g., Mercurial (HG)).
ðŸŒŸ Why Use Version Control?
âœ… Tracks all changes and keeps a history
âœ… Supports collaboration among multiple developers
âœ… Enables rollback to previous versions
âœ… Facilitates branching, merging, and testing new features
