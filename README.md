# **SUBVERSION**  

Subversion software is also known as **SVN**. It is an open-source version control system. Through Subversion, we can look at the previous version of a file and track the changes over time.  

## **Types of Version Control Systems**  

- **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):** There is a single central server that stores all the versions.  
- **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):** Each user has a copy of the full repository.  

## **Why Do We Use Version Control?**  

- To track all the changes and keep the history.  
- We can roll back to the previous version when needed.  
- We can merge new features.
